                    <ul>
                        <li>Regardless of the actual number of days worked within any given month, all employed nurses
                            are entitled to receive their full monthly salary. This condition is intended to ensure
                            financial stability and job security for our staff.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This salary guarantee is conditional upon the nurse being assigned to at least one active
                            duty during the month. If the nurse is not assigned or available for work, the guarantee may
                            not apply, subject to the provisions outlined in Section 3 on Employment Status and
                            Termination.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Clients wishing to terminate nursing services must provide a minimum of one week's notice
                            prior to the intended termination date. This advance notice is crucial to allow adequate
                            time for administrative adjustments and to ensure the continuity of care for all clients.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Failure to comply with the notification requirement as stated in Section 2.1 may result in
                            the client being liable for the payment of services that would have been rendered during the
                            notice period. This is to ensure that nurses are compensated for the scheduled time that
                            could have been allocated to other assignments.

                            Nurses are employed on a monthly basis, with their continuation of employment contingent
                            upon the fulfillment of their duties and compliance with all applicable policies and
                            standards as set forth by the employer.

                            The employer reserves the right to terminate employment under circumstances including, but
                            not limited to, non-compliance with healthcare regulations, breach of contract, or failure
                            to meet professional standards. Standard termination policies including notice periods and
                            severance (if applicable) will be adhered to, in compliance with local labor laws.
